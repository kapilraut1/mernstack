Data structures is about how data is stored in different structures. It tells you about how data can be stored. 

types of DS
i. Primitive DS- int, float, char, string
ii. Abstract DS- linkedlist, arrays, stacks, trees, queues

Algorithm
It is a step-by step procedure or instructions to solve a given problem.

Data Structures and Algorithm
DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.

By understanding DSA, you can:

Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.
